# SLO_Dashboard

In this project I plotted student success data as a function of year and campus (it would have been desirable to do by modality by campus, i.e., in person vs hybrid, but the course codes were not updated from 2020-2022 to reflect these differences so it wasn't possible to extract the information from the data provided).  Data cleaning included translating course codes to campuses, which changed during the data gap from 2020-2021, and this data was then put into Tableau to see if there are any overall trends.  

The vizzes are:

CHM152 : https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/stephen.stewart4198/viz/CHM152SLOPerformance/CHM151SLOPerformance

The python code and raw data files are uploaded as well since they do not contain PII.

Key findings that were pre- and post-pandemic success rates remained fairly constant, and the campus did not seem to have a major impact on student success.  Students typically did worse on course material that was covered later in the course, which makes sense as that tends to be the harder material.
